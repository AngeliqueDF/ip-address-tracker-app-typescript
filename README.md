## Description

This app is an IP address tracker built with HTML, CSS, and TypeScript. It is a challenge created by Frontend Mentor.

> Your users should be able to:
>
> - View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
> - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
> - See their own IP address on the map on the initial page load
> - Search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location

### How I built this project

<p align="center">
	<img alt="Screenshot of the IP address tracker app on mobile." width="33%" src="./src/images/screenshot-mobile.png" />
</p>

#### HTML/CSS

1. First built the UI with a mobile first approach. The design has two breakpoints: at 375px and 1440px. See the [style guide](./style-guide.md).

#### OOP TypeScript

When planning this project, it became clear that a robust solution needed to use OOP concepts. Especially whenn use the Leaflet library properly. TypeScript helped as it added features that simplify the implementation of classes.

Doing this, I avoided:

- Writing extra code just to create new tiles/layers for the map and then having to clean up after every search.
- Writing my own, potentially buggy code by taking advantage of the classes already available.
- Having one large code file which would have made debugging more difficult.

I also managed to make this app functional for free. By using `node`'s native utilities.

<br />

### Recommended technologies and tools

- VS Code type hints.
- TypeScript.
- The Leaflet library.
- ipgeolocation.io to get any IP address information needed by the app.

<br />

## Status

The app works. But I am still reviewing the code.

### Planned changes

- [x] Make the app work when the user searches a domain name.
